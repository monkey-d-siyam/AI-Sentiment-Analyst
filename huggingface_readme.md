# AI-Powered Multi-Class Text Classification
### Production-Ready NLP Pipeline & Deployment

This Space hosts the live deployment of the **AI Context Analyst**, a laboratory project for CSE440: Natural Language Processing II.

## 🚀 Overview
The system categorizes unstructured text into 9+ distinct categories (Business, Science, Sports, etc.) using a comparative approach between classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning architectures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.11)
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM architecture)
- **NLP Utilities**: Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- **Deployment**: Dockerized on Hugging Face Spaces

## 🏁 How to Use
1. Enter any text snippet, question, or news headline in the text area.
2. Click **"Analyze Narrative"**.
3. View the predicted category and the model's confidence score.
